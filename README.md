# bicielx-json

This is a simple, web-scrapping method to obtain BiciElx stations data, as they don't provide a public URL to that data.

It comes with `http-server` module so you can serve the JSON file in your server.

To start, open `stations.js` and set up the interval (in ms) to obtain the data. Then, run `node stations.js` and you're ready to go.
